[Week 1] Hello Minecraft
========================

Summary
-------

Welcome to the first week of Minecraft Mods (alternate name: Mastering Minecraft)!

We saw the basics of how the library works and what we are going to do with it.  

We are going to make our programming environment more and more advanced as the 10 weeks goes on,
but for now, please check out the :doc:`env101`.  


Recap of mcpi library
---------------------

Primarily, you can do the following things with the library

1. Move the player
2. Get the player's location
3. Set blocks
4. Get block information

There are many things you can do with this. 

Expected Homework: Brainstorming
--------------------------------

By the time you come to Week 2, you should have ideas! 

The first project will be our Architect project.  As Architects, your job is to build something
huge and awesome. But, as programmers, we like things to be done for us by writing some code. 

So, you will write a program which builds a huge structure.  It could be something like the following:

1. A sky castle
2. A maze (algorithms for this are tough and interesting!)
3. A moving structure (how could you get moving platforms?)
4. A giant tree house 

Anything you can think about making, you can make with a program. 

To make things with programs, you have to plan out, piece by piece, exactly how it will be made.
How will you connect all of the walls?  What about the roof?  How do you make corridors?
