[Week 5] Interactive: Planning
==============================

Interactive Project Overview
----------------------------

In this project, we will take what we've learned about how to modify the Minecraft world
and interact with the user.  This doesn't just mean getting commands from a player in game
and carrying out tasks.  It means having the code be constantly adjusting to the player in some way. 

I gave two examples in class:

1. A glass cube that surrounded me and moved as I moved
2. A script which continuously spawned dynamite whereever I looked

The two groups began planning their projects and gave proposal presentations in front of the class.
