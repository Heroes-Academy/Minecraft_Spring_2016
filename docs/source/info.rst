What are the goals of this course?
----------------------------------

The first and main goal of this course is to have a great time programming and 
building cool things in Minecraft! The API we will be working with allows for simple functions: finding the position and identity of entities, creating blocks, and moving the player.  Using this API, students will build two substantial projects, each composing a 3-week chunk of the course.  The courses will be selected from (though not limited to) the following possible topics:

1. Algorithmic Architecture: building a structure using control structure, like loops and conditional statements.
2. Interactive Interfaces: querying the game state to detect changes and react to those changes in deterministic ways.  Examples include using the Minecraft chat to cast spells that turn the floor into lava, teleport the player, or anything the students can imagine.

In doing so, we will work on developing the following skills:

1. Code design
    - going from an idea to a structured project 
2. Code maintainability
    - Code is more often read that it is written.  
    - Programmers frequently revisit old code and scratch their head trying to figure out why they named a variable some obscure name, or used a weird magical number to make things work. 
    - We will work on starting good habits early and focus on code that their peers can easily understand
3. Agile development
    - One should always get a minimum working product before optimizing, adding bells and whistles, and doing anything that complicates the underlying logic. 
    - Agile development is the view that there should always be a working model and that the development cycle---design, develop, and test---should be as fast as possible with new features being added incrementally.
4. Unit tests
    - Waiting until an entire program is done to test the components leads to a huge increase in debugging time, headaches, and demotivation.
    - Doing unit tests, even small ones that don't require much overhead, means designing, writing, and testing components that have expected inputs and outputs.  

    

What are the expectations of this course?
-----------------------------------------
I expect that...

1. You will ask questions when you do not get something.
2. You will keep up with the work.
3. You will fail fast:
  - Failing is good
  - We learn when we fail
  - We only find bugs when code fails; we rarely hunt for bugs when code is working
4. You will not copy and paste code from the internet
  - You are only cheating yourself.
  - It won't bother me if you do it, but you will not learn the material.
5. You will try the homework at least once and email me with solutions or questions by Wednesday
