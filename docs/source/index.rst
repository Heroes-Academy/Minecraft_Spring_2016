HEROES Academy: Minecraft Mods, Spring 2016
===========================================

Course Description
------------------

By programming Minecraft Mods with Python, you can create interactive mini-games, create immense structures with a single command, control the world around you using the Minecraft chat and your own spell system, or use a simple Artificial Intelligence to control a character and fight monsters for you.

In this project-based course, students will be immersed in a development environment that gives them complete control over the immensely fun game, Minecraft.  Along the way, they will hone their software engineering skills by explicitly designing their projects, presenting them in front of their classmates, working collaboratively and creating readable code, focusing on working programs with incremental feature additions, and testing their code early and often to amplify their debugging ability.  Students will leave the course not only with a computational mastery of Minecraft, but with a heightened ability to design, develop, and test their code.
