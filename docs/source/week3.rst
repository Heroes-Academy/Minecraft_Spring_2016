[Week 3] Architect: Implementation
==================================

Summary
-------

Today, we are going over how to debug code that goes wrong.  
You will be working on your projects and hopefully getting it to the next milestone or two. 

Additional summaries will come after the course. 


Expected Homework
-----------------

By next week, you should have a working bare-bones example of your project.

As a heads up, next week, we will work on it in class, but the last hour will be dedicated to the groups
preparing to present their work, presenting the work, and then everyone discussing
the code.  


Slides
------

Will be posted soon or after class.
